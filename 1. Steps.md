Here is a step-by-step explanation of the process, using the figures directly from your analysis to show how the theory applies to your specific valuation.

### **1. Understand the Business and Industry (Your Starting Assumptions)**

The first step is to quantify your understanding of the company. You've done this in the **OPERATING INPUT DATA** and **RATE INPUT DATA** sections.

*   **Business Scale & Profitability:** You've established that Ergos Agritech is a company with **$80.00 Million in Revenue** and **$3.00 Million in EBITDA** in the base year (ending 07-03-25).
*   **Key Assumptions:** You've defined the core drivers for your forecast, including a **Short Term Revenue Growth Rate of 5.50%** (which then declines over the years) and a **Long Term (Perpetual) Growth Rate of 2.50%**.

### **2. Forecast Free Cash Flows (The "FCFF PROJECTION" Table)**

This is the core of the model, where you project the company's ability to generate cash over the next 10 years.

*   **Revenue Projection:** Your model starts with **$80.00M** in revenue and grows it annually based on the "Revenue %" row. For example, in year 07-03-26, revenue is $80.00M * (1 + 5.50%) = **$84.40M**. You correctly show this growth declining over the 10-year period to the long-term rate.
*   **Calculating NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax):** You correctly calculate the earnings available to all capital providers.
    *   **EBIT:** You calculate Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) by subtracting Depreciation & Amortization from EBITDA. For 07-03-27: $3.33M (EBITDA) - $35.50M (D&A) = **-$32.18M** (EBIT).
    *   **Taxes:** You apply the **20.00% Tax Rate** to EBIT. In years with negative EBIT (a loss), this results in a tax benefit (a negative tax expense). For 07-03-27: -$32.18M * 20% = **-$6.44M** (Income Tax).
    *   **NOPAT:** You arrive at NOPAT by subtracting the tax from EBIT. For 07-03-27: -$32.18M - (-$6.44M) = **-$25.74M**.
*   **Calculating Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** You then adjust NOPAT for non-cash items and investments to find the actual cash generated. The formula you've used is: `FCFF = NOPAT - Capital Expenditure + Depreciation & Amortization`.
    *   Let's check the calculation for 07-03-27: `-$25.74M (NOPAT) - $3.05M (CapEx) + $35.50M (D&A) = $6.68M (FCFF)`. This matches your table perfectly.
    *   The result is the crucial **Free Cash Flow for Firm (FCFF)** row, which projects cash flows from **$0.05M** to **$8.93M** over the 10 years.

### **3. Determine the Discount Rate (Your "RATE INPUT DATA")**

To find the present value of future cash flows, you need a discount rate. You have used the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

*   In your **RATE INPUT DATA** table, you have determined the **WACC to be 10.00%**. This rate represents the blended cost of the company's debt and equity, and it reflects the riskiness of the projected cash flows.

### **4. Calculate the Terminal Value (Embedded in the "SUMMARY" Table)**

A company is assumed to operate beyond the 10-year forecast period. The Terminal Value (TV) captures the value of all cash flows after year 10. You've used the perpetuity growth model.

*   **Formula:** `TV = [Final Year FCFF * (1 + Long-Term Growth Rate)] / (WACC - Long-Term Growth Rate)`
*   **Your Calculation:** Using your numbers for the 10.00% WACC scenario:
    *   Final Year FCFF (07-03-35): **$8.93M**
    *   Long-Term Growth Rate: **2.50%**
    *   WACC: **10.00%**
    *   TV = [$8.93M * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.10 - 0.025) = $9.15M / 0.075 = **$122.00M**.
*   This matches the **"Terminal Value @ Rate"** of **$122.00M** shown in your summary table.

### **5. & 6. Discount Cash Flows and Calculate Total Company Value**

This is where you bring everything together to find the value of the company *today*.

*   **PV of Forecasted FCFs:** You discount each of the 10 projected FCFFs back to today's value using the 10.00% WACC. The sum of these present values is shown in your **DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SUMMARY** table as **"FCF over Projection Period,"** which is **$46.03M**.
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** The Terminal Value of $122.00M is a future value at the end of year 10. You discount it back to today: PV(TV) = $122.00M / (1 + 0.10)^10 = **$47.01M**. This matches your **"Terminal Cash Flow"** column.
*   **Total Company Value (Enterprise Value):** You sum the two present values to get the total intrinsic value of the company.
    *   $46.03M (PV of FCFs) + $47.01M (PV of TV) = **$93.04M**.
*   This calculation perfectly matches the **"Company Value"** in your summary table and the final **"TOTAL COMPANY VALUE"** box at the top right.

### **7. Perform Sensitivity Analysis (Your "SUMMARY" Table)**

A single DCF value is sensitive to its assumptions. You have wisely included a sensitivity analysis on the WACC.

*   By using the **"WACC Sensitivity" input of 1.00%**, your summary table automatically calculates the company's value at a **9.00%, 10.00%, and 11.00%** discount rate.
*   This provides a valuation range of **$81.88M to $107.65M**, which is much more useful than a single point estimate. It shows how a change in perceived risk (the discount rate) affects the final valuation.
*   The **"Percent Value"** columns are also insightful, showing that at a 10% WACC, **50.53%** of Ergos Agritech's value is derived from the Terminal Value, highlighting the importance of the long-term growth assumption.

### **8. & 9. Compare with Market Data and Report (Your Next Steps)**

Your completed DCF model provides an intrinsic value for Ergos Agritech.

*   **Your Conclusion:** Based on your assumptions, the intrinsic value of Ergos Agritech as of July 3, 2025, is **$93.04 Million**.
*   **Next Steps:** The logical next steps would be to compare this intrinsic value to market-based valuations (like public company comparables or precedent transactions) and to clearly document your key assumptions in a final report.
